## Getting Started

Once the Segment library is integrated, toggle CleverTap on in your Segment integrations, and add your CleverTap Account ID and CleverTap Account Token which you can find in the CleverTap Dashboard under Settings.

CleverTap supports the identify and track methods.

## Identify

When you identify a user, we'll pass that user's information to CleverTap with userId as CleverTap's Identity value. A number of Segment's special traits map to CleverTap's standard user profile fields.  Youâ€™ll pass the key on the left into Segment and we will transform it to the key on the right before sending to CleverTap.

- `name` maps to `Name`
- `birthday` maps to `DOB`
- `avatar` maps to `Photo`
- `gender` maps to `Gender`
- `phone` maps to `Phone`
- `email` maps to `Email`

All other traits will be sent to CleverTap as custom attributes.


## Track

When you track an event, we will send that event to CleverTap as a custom event.


## Android

### Integrating

1. Add the CleverTap Segment Integration dependency to your app build.gradle:

    `compile 'com.clevertap.android:clevertap-segment-android:+'`

    **Note**: Our group Id is `com.clevertap.android`, not `com.segment.analytics.android.integrations`.

2. Next, declare CleverTap's integration in your Analytics instance:

   ``` 
   Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(context, "YOUR_WRITE_KEY_HERE")  
     .use(CleverTapIntegration.FACTORY)  
     ...  
     .build();  
   ```

### Integrating Push     

1. In your AndroidManifest.xml, add relevant permissions.  

    ```
    <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE" />
    <permission android:name="[YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME].permission.C2D_MESSAGE" android:protectionLevel="signature"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="[YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME].permission.C2D_MESSAGE" />
    ```

2. In your AndroidManifest.xml, register CleverTap's GcmBroadcastReceiver.  

    ```
    <receiver
        android:name="com.clevertap.android.sdk.GcmBroadcastReceiver"
        android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND">  
        <intent-filter>  
            <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" />  
            <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION" />  
            <category android:name="[YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME]" />  
        </intent-filter>  
    </receiver>`  
    ```

3. Inside the application tag of your AndroidManifest.xml, add your GCM Sender ID and google play services version.

    ```
    <meta-data  
        android:name="GCM_SENDER_ID:    
        android:value="id:YOUR_SENDER_ID" />  
    ```    
    ```
    <meta-data  
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"  
        android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />    
    ```

4. For more in-depth information, visit our [Android push integration documentation](https://support.clevertap.com/integration/android-sdk/#push-notification-support).

### In-App Notifications

1. In your AndroidManifest.xml, add the CleverTap InAppNotificationActivity.

    ```
    <activity  
            android:name="com.clevertap.android.sdk.InAppNotificationActivity"  
            android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"  
            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" />  
    ```

    No further action is required to integrate in-app notifications, which are registered for and requested by default by our CleverTap Segment integration.


### Sample App

CleverTap has created a sample Android application that integrates CleverTap via Segment. Check it out at the [Github repo](https://github.com/CleverTap/clevertap-segment-android-example).

## iOS 

### Integrating

1. Add the CleverTap Segment Pod to your Podfile:

    `pod 'Segment-CleverTap'`

    We recommend using the latest version on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Segment-CleverTap) since it will contain the most up to date features and bug fixes.

2. Next, declare CleverTap's integration in your app delegate instance:

    ```
    SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:@"YOUR_WRITE_KEY_HERE"];
    [config use:[SEGCleverTapIntegrationFactory instance]];
    [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];
    ```

### Integrating Push     

1. Follow the directions to register for push at: [https://segment.com/docs/libraries/ios/#how-do-i-use-push-notifications-](https://segment.com/docs/libraries/ios/#how-do-i-use-push-notifications-).

2. In your application's application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: method, add the following:

    `[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] receivedRemoteNotification:userInfo];`

3. If you integrated the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: in your app, add the following to that method:

    `[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] receivedRemoteNotification:userInfo];`

4. If you implemented handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:, add the following to that method:

    `[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] handleActionWithIdentifier:identifier forRemoteNotification:userInfo];`

### In-App Notifications

No further action is required to integrate in-app notifications, which are registered for and requested by default by our CleverTap Segment integration.
